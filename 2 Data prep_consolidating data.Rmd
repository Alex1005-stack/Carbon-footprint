#A. 6 Take share of porfolio times 40.9 billion USD (acc. to Harvard Magazine: https://www.harvardmagazine.com/2019/09/harvard-endowment-increases-4-3-percent-to-40-9-billion) to extend available information as proxy to the entire . Also translate market cap from in millions to simple Euro amounts. Also calculate Harvard's ownership share in company. Also calculate the CO2 footprint in MT owned by Harvard

#CHALLENGE: Dissonance between scaling and company values in years with no/little data. For 2005 2006, 2007 only First Energy Cooperation and SEARS Canada of the HMC portfolio provided CDP  data, therefore rebased share of portfolio is extremely high and ownership share exceeds 1. To resolve, I removed all years with scarce data by only looking at years where we had carbon footptint data for at least 30% of the portfolio ( from 2014 on):
