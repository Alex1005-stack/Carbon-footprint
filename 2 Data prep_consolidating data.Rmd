#A. Consolidation of carbon footprints, SEC filings and Bloomberg market capitalization into one central table

#A.1 Load relevant datasets

SEC_filings_cons <- read_rds("clean-data/SEC_filings_cons.rds")
CCF_combined <- read_rds("clean-data/ccf_combined.rds")
Market_caps <- read_xlsx("C:/Users/Alexander Klueber/Desktop/University/Coursework/Fall 2019/GOV 1005 Data/Final project/Final project/Funds/Market caps.xlsx")


#A.2 Join tables on Tickers and ISIN

HMC_CCF <- CCF_combined %>%
           separate(Ticker, c("Ticker", "Country_code")) %>% # Isolate matchable Ticker
           left_join(SEC_filings_cons, by = c("Ticker", "Ticker")) %>% # Join CCF with SEC_filings
           filter(!is.na(`Share of portfolio`)) %>% # Limiting to the observations that could be matched 
          left_join(Market_caps, by = c("ISIN", "ISIN"))%>%
           filter(MarketCap_09_30 != "N/A")
  

  #Recasting Market Capitalization as a number
  
  HMC_CCF$MarketCap_09_30 <- as.numeric(HMC_CCF$MarketCap_09_30)

  
#A.3 To rebase ownership share - calcualte share of portfolio available in data per year  

  HMC_CCF_year <- HMC_CCF %>%
                group_by(Year) %>%
                summarize(Total_share_year = sum(`Share of portfolio`))

  
#A.4 Rebase ownership share acc. to share of companies remaining in the dataset

HMC_CCF_v2 <- HMC_CCF %>%
              left_join(HMC_CCF_year, by = c("Year", "Year")) %>%
              mutate(Rebased_portfolio_share = `Share of portfolio`/Total_share_year)


#A.5 CONTROL: Share of portfolio available in data per year must all be 1

HMC_CCF_v2 %>%
  group_by(Year) %>%
  summarize(sum(Rebased_portfolio_share))


#A. 6 Take share of porfolio times 40.9 billion USD (acc. to Harvard Magazine: https://www.harvardmagazine.com/2019/09/harvard-endowment-increases-4-3-percent-to-40-9-billion) to extend available information as proxy to the entire . Also translate market cap from in millions to simple Euro amounts. Also calculate Harvard's ownership share in company. Also calculate the CO2 footprint in MT owned by Harvard 

HMC_CCF_v4 <- HMC_CCF_v2 %>%
  mutate(Ownership_USD = Rebased_portfolio_share*40900000000) %>% #Calculate Harvard's ownership stake of company as product of rebased portfolio share times 40.9 bn
  mutate(MarketCap_USD = MarketCap_09_30*1000000) %>% # Translate company market capitalization into simple dollars
  mutate(Ownership_share = Ownership_USD/MarketCap_USD) %>% # Calculate Harvard's ownership stake in companies
  mutate(Carbon_footprint_owned_MT = Ownership_share*Total) # Calculate Harvard's owned corporate carbon footprint as a result of that


#CHALLENGE: Dissonance between scaling and company values in years with no/little data. For 2005 2006, 2007 only First Energy Cooperation and SEARS Canada of the HMC portfolio provided CDP  data, therefore rebased share of portfolio is extremely high and ownership share exceeds 1. To resolve, I removed all years with scarce data by only looking at years where we had carbon footptint data for at least 30% of the portfolio ( from 2014 on):

HMC_CCF_v5 <- HMC_CCF_v4 %>%
  filter(Year > 2013) %>%
  select(Organisation, Year, Account_Number, Country, Industry, Ticker, Scope_1, Scope_2, Bio_CO2, Total, Rebased_portfolio_share, Ownership_share, Carbon_footprint_owned_MT) # Select relevant columns only


#A. 7 Write dataset to clean-data file for graphical visualization

write_rds(HMC_CCF_v5, "clean-data/HMC_Carbon_Footprint.rds", compress = "none")
